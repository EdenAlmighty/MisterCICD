# Cursor Terminal Configuration Rules

## Terminal Setup

- **Option 1 (Recommended)**: Use Git Bash as the default terminal shell in Cursor
  - More reliable for most commands
  - Better integration with Cursor's terminal
  - Configure terminal.integrated.defaultProfile.windows to "Git Bash"

- **Option 2**: Use PowerShell with specific command flags
  - Works but requires specific flags for test runners
  - May have intermittent hanging issues with some commands

## Test Commands

When running tests in Cursor, use these flags to prevent terminal hanging:

### Vitest (Unit Tests)

- **Use**: `npm run test:unit -- --run` (runs once and exits)
- **Avoid**: `npm run test:unit` (runs in watch mode and hangs)

### Playwright (E2E Tests)

- **Use**: `npx playwright test --reporter=list` (runs once and exits)
- **Use**: `npx playwright test --reporter=dot` (minimal output)
- **Avoid**: `npm run test:e2e` (serves HTML report and hangs)

- **Testing intructions**: Everytime a test fails attempt to fix the component without changing the test and re-run the specific failed test.

### Other Commands

- Always use flags that make commands exit after completion
- Avoid commands that start servers or watch modes without explicit exit conditions
- If a command hangs, try adding `--run`, `--no-watch`, or `--reporter=list` flags

## Terminal Hanging Prevention

- Commands should complete and return to prompt immediately
- If a command hangs, check if it's running in watch mode or serving a report
- Use Ctrl+C to stop hanging commands
- Restart Cursor if terminal issues persist
- The hanging is often caused by test runners not exiting properly

## Shell-Specific Notes

### Git Bash

- Use Unix-style commands: `ls`, `cd`, `pwd`, `cat`, `grep`
- Use `npm` and `git` commands normally
- Tab completion and command history work normally
- Most reliable option for Cursor integration

### PowerShell

- Use PowerShell commands: `Get-ChildItem`, `Get-Location`, etc.
- Requires specific flags for test runners to prevent hanging
- May have intermittent hanging issues
- Use `--run` flag for Vitest and `--reporter=list` for Playwright

## Root Cause

The terminal hanging issue is primarily caused by:

1. Test runners running in watch mode by default
2. Commands that don't exit properly in Cursor's terminal integration
3. Complex shell configurations or prompts
4. Commands that serve HTML reports or wait for user input
