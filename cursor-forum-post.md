# Cursor Terminal Hanging - Finally Fixed! (With a Twist)

Hey everyone! ðŸ‘‹

I've been dealing with this super annoying issue where Cursor's terminal would just hang after running commands, especially tests. Thought I'd share what finally worked for me, plus a pretty interesting story about how I solved it.

## The Problem

So basically, whenever I'd run tests or certain commands, the terminal would just sit there after the command finished. No prompt, nothing - just hanging. I'd have to click to pop the terminal out or restart Cursor to get it working again.

This was happening with:

- `npm run test:unit` (Vitest tests)
- `npm run test:e2e` (Playwright tests)
- Other commands that run in watch mode

Super frustrating when you're trying to work!

## My Setup

- Windows 11
- Latest Cursor
- Terminal setting was "null" (which defaults to PowerShell)
- PowerShell with PSReadLine

## The Meta-Debugging Story

Here's the interesting part - I actually used Cursor's AI assistant to help debug this issue. So basically, the AI was helping debug its own terminal integration problems! ðŸ˜…

We went through this whole iterative process:

1. AI thought it was complex shell prompts causing issues
2. We tried modifying PowerShell profiles
3. Found some PSReadLine version incompatibilities
4. Discovered that test runners were running in watch mode by default
5. Tested switching between PowerShell and Git Bash
6. Finally, after restarting Cursor, the issue just... resolved itself

Pretty wild that the AI could help debug its own system, right?

## What Actually Worked

After all that testing, I found two approaches that work:

### Option 1: Switch to Git Bash

Changed my terminal setting from "null" to "Git Bash" and boom - no more hanging issues. Commands complete and return to prompt immediately.

**Pros:** Everything just works
**Cons:** Need to use Unix commands (`ls` instead of `Get-ChildItem`)

### Option 2: Use Specific Flags with PowerShell

If you want to stick with PowerShell, these flags prevent hanging:

For Vitest:

```bash
npm run test:unit -- --run
```

For Playwright:

```bash
npx playwright test --reporter=list
# or
npx playwright test --reporter=dot
```

The key is making commands exit after completion instead of staying in watch mode.

## Root Cause

From all the testing, the hanging seems to be caused by:

1. Test runners running in watch mode by default
2. Cursor's terminal integration having quirks with certain shells
3. Commands that don't exit properly in the integrated terminal

## The AI Debugging Experience

Using Cursor's AI to debug Cursor's own terminal issues was actually pretty effective! The AI was able to:

- Identify patterns in the hanging behavior
- Suggest systematic troubleshooting approaches
- Test different solutions iteratively
- Document everything for future reference

It's a great example of how AI can help debug complex integration issues, even when the AI itself is part of the system being debugged.

## My Recommendation

I'd say try **Git Bash** first since it's the most reliable. If you need PowerShell, remember the `--run` flag for Vitest and `--reporter=list` for Playwright.

## Questions for You All

- Anyone else experienced this hanging issue?
- What terminal configurations work well for you with Cursor?
- Is this a known issue that's being tracked somewhere?
- Has anyone else used AI assistance to debug Cursor issues?

---

**TL;DR:** Terminal hanging fixed by either switching to Git Bash or using `--run`/`--reporter=list` flags. Also, using AI to debug AI's own terminal issues is a trip! ðŸ˜„

Hope this helps someone else dealing with the same frustration!
